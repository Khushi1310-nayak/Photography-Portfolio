      <p>
       My journey as a photographer began not with a camera, but with curiosity. A quiet fascination with how light played on skin, how shadows told stories, and how a single frame could hold a thousand emotions. Over time, what started as spontaneous clicks turned into a deeper love for capturing the moments that often go unnoticed—the laughter between friends, the quiet strength in someone’s eyes, the fleeting beauty of everyday life.
      </p><br>

<p>I began experimenting with my phone camera, observing textures, natural light, and composition. I didn’t have professional gear in the beginning—just a vision and the patience to learn. I studied angles, color theory, and editing techniques, and slowly transitioned into using a DSLR. That shift gave me the ability to explore more advanced concepts, including manual settings, dynamic range, and focal depth, all of which helped me refine my artistic voice.</p><br>

<p>I’m currently continuing to build my portfolio, exploring different genres and expanding my skills with each shoot. Photography for me isn’t a hobby—it’s a calling. It’s how I observe the world, how I connect with people, and how I leave something behind that’s meaningful. Looking forward, my goal is to collaborate on professional campaigns, travel shoots, and digital media projects. I want to grow not only as an artist but also as a storyteller—someone who sees beauty in the ordinary and transforms it into something unforgettable.

This is more than just experience—this is my lens into the world. Every click of the shutter is a testament to my growth, my passion, and my belief that photography is where heart meets art.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
       <h3>11. Shoot in RAW</h3>
       <p>RAW format preserves more detail and gives you better control in editing—your future self will thank you during post-processing.</p>
